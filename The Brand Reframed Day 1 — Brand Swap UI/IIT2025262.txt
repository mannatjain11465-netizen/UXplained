## Brand Pair Chosen:
WhatsApp → Telegram UI Swap
In this project, I redesigned WhatsApp using Telegram’s visual style.
My aim was to keep WhatsApp’s core features the same, but present them using Telegram’s clean and modern design language.

## Design Approach
I designed three main screens:

1. Hero Screen –
To create a strong first impression using soft gradients, rounded shapes, and simple typography inspired by Telegram.

2. Login Screen –
I used a card-based layout with clear spacing and soft shadows to keep the screen clean and easy to understand.

3. Home Screen –
The chat content remains WhatsApp-like, but the layout, icons, bottom navigation, and floating action button follow Telegram’s UI style.
